# Hello. I am Nate, a.k.a bobnat1

I am a Java based full-stack developer. I like to write web applications as well as static websites. I'm also on the deep end when it comes to anything Linux, as my main rig right now is running Arch. I'm the type of guy to create a Windows VM with a GPU pass-through to play some of my games.
